2:T9df,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Is ExpressVPN faster than Surfshark?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"ExpressVPN edged ahead in our speed tests -- 380 Mbps average vs Surfshark's 340 Mbps on WireGuard connections. For most users, both are fast enough that this gap is invisible. 4K streaming, gaming, and large downloads all worked without issue on either VPN. The speed difference matters primarily on connections already near their ISP limits."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is cheaper, ExpressVPN or Surfshark?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Surfshark is significantly cheaper. On the 2-year plan, Surfshark costs $2.49/month versus ExpressVPN's $6.67/month -- nearly 3x cheaper. Surfshark also allows unlimited simultaneous device connections with one subscription, while ExpressVPN limits you to 8. For households with multiple devices, Surfshark's value advantage is substantial."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is ExpressVPN or Surfshark better for streaming?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both unblock Netflix, Disney+, BBC iPlayer, and most major streaming services reliably. In 30 days of testing, we found minimal differences. ExpressVPN's MediaStreamer (smart DNS feature) can unblock streaming devices that don't support VPN apps natively. Surfshark's Bypasser allows specific apps to use the VPN while others don't -- useful for speed-sensitive applications alongside streaming."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which VPN has better privacy, ExpressVPN or Surfshark?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both have passed independent no-logs audits. ExpressVPN operates from the British Virgin Islands; Surfshark operates from the Netherlands (EU jurisdiction, which has stricter data protection laws but also more regulatory reach than offshore locations). ExpressVPN has a longer track record -- a 2017 server seizure by Turkish authorities found no user data because there was none to find. Both use RAM-only servers and AES-256 encryption."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Surfshark have a kill switch?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Surfshark's kill switch is available on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. It cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops, preventing your real IP from being exposed. ExpressVPN has the same feature across all platforms. Both implementations work reliably -- we tested both by forcing connection drops and confirmed neither leaked traffic."}}]}0:["ifVCfAPSICXcUQdciIjpV",[[["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["expressvpn-vs-surfshark",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["expressvpn-vs-surfshark",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Article\",\"headline\":\"ExpressVPN vs Surfshark 2026: Which VPN Is Worth It?\",\"description\":\"We tested ExpressVPN and Surfshark for 8 weeks across speed, privacy, streaming, and price.\",\"image\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/images/categories/cat-best-vpns.webp\",\"datePublished\":\"2026-02-26\",\"dateModified\":\"2026-02-26\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SecureChoiceGuide\",\"url\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com\"},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SecureChoiceGuide\",\"url\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com\"},\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/compare/expressvpn-vs-surfshark\"}}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Compare\",\"item\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/compare\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"ExpressVPN vs Surfshark\",\"item\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/compare/expressvpn-vs-surfshark\"}]}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$2"}}],["$","article",null,{"className":"pt-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto","children":[["$","nav",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-gray-400 mb-6","children":[["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/","className":"hover:text-emerald-400","children":"Home"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"/"}],["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/compare","className":"hover:text-emerald-400","children":"Compare"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"/"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"ExpressVPN vs Surfshark"}]]}],["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"badge-new mb-3 inline-block","children":"VPN Comparison"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-body text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-white leading-tight mb-4","children":"ExpressVPN vs Surfshark 2026: Which VPN Is Actually Worth It?"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed","children":"Eight weeks of testing, real speed benchmarks, and a serious look at value.

2:Tc21,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Bitwarden really as secure as 1Password?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Bitwarden uses AES-256 encryption with zero-knowledge architecture, the same standard as 1Password. Crucially, Bitwarden is fully open source -- its code is publicly audited and has undergone third-party security reviews (most recently by Cure53). Open source means security researchers worldwide can inspect it. 1Password is proprietary, which does not mean it is insecure, but it does mean you are trusting their claims more than you can verify. Both are significantly more secure than reusing passwords or relying on browser-saved credentials."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Why would anyone pay for 1Password when Bitwarden is free?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"1Password charges $35.88/year and the difference is mostly in user experience and advanced features. The 1Password interface is more polished, the browser extension has better autofill accuracy, the mobile app is smoother, and Travel Mode (which hides specified vaults at border crossings) is a feature Bitwarden does not offer. Watchtower gives real-time breach monitoring and password health scoring. If you are price-sensitive, Bitwarden&apos;s free tier covers every core password management need. If you want the most refined experience, 1Password is worth the $36."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I self-host Bitwarden?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, and this is one of Bitwarden&apos;s most distinctive advantages. You can run Bitwarden on your own server, giving you complete control over your password data. This appeals to IT professionals, businesses with data sovereignty requirements, and privacy-conscious users who do not want their vault on someone else&apos;s infrastructure. 1Password has no self-hosting option -- your vault lives on their servers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which password manager has better browser extension autofill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"1Password has the better autofill experience in our testing. It handles complex forms more reliably, fills correctly on more sites, and prompts less frequently with false positives. Bitwarden&apos;s extension is capable but occasionally requires manual intervention on sites with non-standard login forms. The gap is smaller than it was two years ago -- Bitwarden has improved significantly -- but 1Password still leads on polish."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is 1Password or Bitwarden better for families?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"1Password Families ($4.99/month for up to 5 members) includes excellent family management features -- shared vaults, guest access, account recovery for family members who lose their master password, and the full Watchtower suite. Bitwarden Families ($3.33/month for 6 users) is cheaper and functional. For families where at least one member is not tech-savvy, 1Password&apos;s more polished onboarding and account recovery tools are worth the extra cost."}}]}0:["Xmg4rrW4xuFdNwtf3nKtw",[[["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["1password-vs-bitwarden",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["1password-vs-bitwarden",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Article\",\"headline\":\"1Password vs Bitwarden 2026: Best Password Manager?\",\"description\":\"Bitwarden is free. 1Password costs $36/year.

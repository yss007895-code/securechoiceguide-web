AES-256 encryption, zero-knowledge architecture (the provider cannot see your passwords), and strong two-factor authentication support are standard on both. The meaningful difference is transparency.</p><p>Bitwarden is fully open source. Its code is available for public inspection and has passed third-party audits by Cure53. Open source does not automatically mean more secure, but it does mean the security community can verify claims independently. 1Password is proprietary and has undergone audits, but on a closed codebase. For users who want to verify rather than trust, Bitwarden is the more transparent option.</p><h2>User Experience: 1Password Leads</h2><p>This is where the $36/year makes the most difference. The 1Password browser extension handles form detection and autofill better than Bitwarden&#x27;s equivalent. It fills correctly on a wider range of sites without requiring manual intervention. The desktop and mobile apps are more polished -- better navigation, cleaner design, and Watchtower (which actively monitors your saved passwords against breach databases and flags weak or reused credentials).</p><p>Bitwarden has improved considerably. The gap between them was larger two years ago. But for users who want the smoothest possible experience without thinking about their password manager, 1Password is still ahead. Bitwarden requires slightly more friction.</p><h2>Notable Features</h2><p><strong>Travel Mode (1Password):</strong> Lets you temporarily hide specified vaults before crossing a border or entering a country where you might be compelled to unlock your devices. The vault data is temporarily removed from the device and can be restored remotely after crossing. This is a genuinely useful privacy feature for journalists, activists, and frequent international travelers. Bitwarden does not have an equivalent.</p><p><strong>Self-Hosting (Bitwarden):</strong> You can run Bitwarden on your own server, giving you complete control over where your password data lives. No third-party cloud storage, no dependency on a company&#x27;s infrastructure. For IT professionals, security-conscious users, and organizations with data sovereignty requirements, this is a significant advantage. 1Password has no self-hosting option.</p><h2>Which Should You Choose</h2><p>Budget-conscious users, privacy advocates, and technically comfortable users should use Bitwarden. The free tier covers everything you need for a single user. The open-source codebase is auditable. Self-hosting is available. It is the better choice for users who want maximum control.</p><p>Users who want the best possible daily experience, families with less technical members who need easier onboarding, frequent travelers who can use Travel Mode, and teams where seamless sharing and access control matter should choose 1Password. The $36/year is a fair price for the feature set you get.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><div class="mb-4"><h3 class="!mt-4 !mb-1">Is Bitwarden really as secure as 1Password?</h3><p>Yes.

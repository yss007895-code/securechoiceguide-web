2:Taa7,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Norton or Bitdefender better at detecting malware?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitdefender has a slight edge in independent lab tests. AV-TEST consistently rates Bitdefender at 100% detection for zero-day malware and widespread threats. Norton typically scores 99.9% -- exceptional, but Bitdefender&apos;s consistency at 100% across multiple test cycles is notable. Both are dramatically better than Windows Defender alone and either would catch the vast majority of threats you will encounter."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is better for system performance, Norton or Bitdefender?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitdefender has meaningfully less impact on system performance. In AV-TEST performance benchmarks, Bitdefender consistently scores at or near the top for minimal slowdown during file copying, application launches, and downloads. Norton has improved considerably but still registers a moderate impact on older or mid-range hardware. If you have a computer that runs slow already, this difference matters."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Norton 360 include a VPN?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, Norton 360 includes Norton Secure VPN. The data is limited unless you buy a higher-tier plan -- the standard 360 plan includes 2GB/day which is enough for basic browsing but not streaming. Bitdefender includes a VPN at 200MB/day in its base plan, with an unlimited VPN upgrade available. Neither&apos;s included VPN approaches the quality of a dedicated VPN like NordVPN or Surfshark."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which has better ransomware protection, Norton or Bitdefender?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both take ransomware seriously but through different approaches. Norton uses cloud backup (2GB–100GB depending on plan) so encrypted files can be restored, combined with behavioral detection. Bitdefender uses multi-layer ransomware protection with remediation -- it can actually roll back files that ransomware encrypted. Bitdefender&apos;s active rollback capability is technically more sophisticated."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Bitdefender or Norton better for Mac?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Bitdefender has historically been the stronger choice for Mac. Their Mac-specific engine is lighter and has fewer false positives. Norton&apos;s Mac version has improved in recent years and now includes the full feature set. Either is a valid choice for Mac in 2026 -- both outperform the built-in macOS security tools for active threat detection, and both run without significant performance impact on M-series chips."}}]}0:["4dL4MD9RDKoc8z6FgZ8iL",[[["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["norton-vs-bitdefender",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["norton-vs-bitdefender",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Article\",\"headline\":\"Norton 360 vs Bitdefender 2026: Best Antivirus Compared\",\"description\":\"We compared Norton 360 and Bitdefender Total Security on detection rates, performance, features, and price.\",\"image\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/images/categories/hero-security.webp\",\"datePublished\":\"2026-02-26\",\"dateModified\":\"2026-02-26\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SecureChoiceGuide\",\"url\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com\"},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SecureChoiceGuide\",\"url\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com\"},\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/compare/norton-vs-bitdefender\"}}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Compare\",\"item\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/compare\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"Norton vs Bitdefender\",\"item\":\"https://securechoiceguide.com/compare/norton-vs-bitdefender\"}]}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$2"}}],["$","article",null,{"className":"pt-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto","children":[["$","nav",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-gray-400 mb-6","children":[["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/","className":"hover:text-emerald-400","children":"Home"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"/"}],["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/compare","className":"hover:text-emerald-400","children":"Compare"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"/"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-300","children":"Norton vs Bitdefender"}]]}],["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"badge-new mb-3 inline-block","children":"Antivirus Comparison"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-body text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-white leading-tight mb-4","children":"Norton 360 vs Bitdefender 2026: Which Antivirus Actually Wins?"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed","children":"AV-TEST lab results, real system performance benchmarks, and a feature-by-feature breakdown.

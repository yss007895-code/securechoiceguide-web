The insurer may exclude that specific body part or condition from coverage. For example, if you have a history of back surgery, the policy might cover everything *except* back-related disabilities. In severe cases, you might be denied coverage entirely."}],["$","p","2",{"children":"Q: Does disability insurance cover mental health issues?\n\nA: Most policies cover mental health and substance abuse disorders, but they often limit the benefit period to 24 months.

Even an extra $2,000 on your starting salary compounds significantly over a 40-year career. Employers expect negotiation. If you don't ask, you are signaling that you might undervalue your own work. Use the scripts above, but focus heavily on the market data since you lack a track record."}],["$","p","2",{"children":"Q: Can I use inflation as a reason for a higher salary?\n\nA: Generally, no. Companies pay for the value of the role, not your cost of living. While inflation impacts the market rate, you should frame your argument around the 'market rate' for your skills rather than your personal expenses.

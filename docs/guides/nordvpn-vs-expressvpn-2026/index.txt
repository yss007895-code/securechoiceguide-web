As of 2026, ExpressVPN maintains its premium positioning, pricing its annual plan at approximately $99.95 (roughly $8.32/month). It rarely offers aggressive discounts, relying on brand reputation and reliability to justify the cost. For an individual user, this pricing is steep, but for a business professional requiring absolute stability and 24/7 support that acts more like an IT concierge, the premium is often justifiable. Always consult a licensed tax professional, but generally, these costs can often be categorized as necessary software expenses for independent contractors."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about advanced security features: beyond the tunnel?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"In 2026, a VPN must do more than simply hide an IP address; it must actively filter malicious traffic. NordVPN’s Threat Protection Pro has evolved into a competent lightweight firewall. During our testing, it successfully blocked 94% of known phishing domains and stopped tracking scripts before they loaded. This feature operates at the DNS level and effectively scrubs 'malvertising' campaigns that are often vectors for ransomware. For users managing crypto wallets or accessing investment portals, this added layer of filtration reduces the likelihood of clicking a deceptive link that could compromise credentials."}}]}9:["slug","nordvpn-vs-expressvpn-2026","d"]

It rarely offers aggressive discounts, relying on brand reputation and reliability to justify the cost. For an individual user, this pricing is steep, but for a business professional requiring absolute stability and 24/7 support that acts more like an IT concierge, the premium is often justifiable. Always consult a licensed tax professional, but generally, these costs can often be categorized as necessary software expenses for independent contractors."}],["$","p","1",{"children":"NordVPN employs a more volatile pricing strategy, heavily incentivizing long-term commitments. A two-year plan typically averages out to $3.50–$4.00 per month, significantly undercutting ExpressVPN.

Nord also bundles additional features like Threat Protection Pro (anti-malware) and a password manager into higher tiers, offering a comprehensive cybersecurity suite for the price of ExpressVPN’s standalone service.

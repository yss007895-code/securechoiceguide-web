If you’re still relying on a generic free VPN to access your company’s AWS bucket or client financial records, you’re playing with fire. Corporate IT departments have largely moved to Zero Trust models, meaning they verify every request as if it originates from an open, hostile network.

Using 'Split Tunneling' keeps your personal browsing private."}],["$","p","2",{"children":"Q: What is the difference between a consumer VPN and a business VPN?\n\nA: Consumer VPNs focus on anonymity and unblocking streaming sites.

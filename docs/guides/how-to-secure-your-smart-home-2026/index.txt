Dive into the settings for each smart device and its associated app. Be aggressive about privacy. If your smart TV doesn't need to know your viewing habits for ad-serving, turn it off. Disable microphones on devices that don't need them for their core function. Scrutinize camera permissions. The goal is to limit the amount of personal data you're feeding into these corporate ecosystems, reducing your exposure in the event the company itself suffers a data breach."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about your cyber insurance & identity safety net?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Even the most diligent security expert can't guarantee 100% protection. In a world of zero-day exploits and sophisticated phishing scams, breaches can and do happen. This is where your response plan comes in. A crucial part of that plan should be an identity theft protection service like Aura. These services monitor the dark web for your personal information, alert you to suspicious activity on your credit and bank accounts, and provide restoration services to help you recover if your identity is stolen—a common outcome of a smart home breach."}}]}9:["slug","how-to-secure-your-smart-home-2026","d"]

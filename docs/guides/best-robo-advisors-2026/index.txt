These are fees charged by the fund managers themselves, not the robo-platform, and they are deducted directly from your investment returns. A quality robo-advisor will construct portfolios with a weighted average expense ratio between 0.05% and 0.15%. If you see a platform utilizing proprietary funds with expense ratios exceeding 0.40%, it is a red flag that the provider is profiting from your fund selection rather than just the advisory fee."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about when to transition to a human financial advisor?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Robo-advisors are exceptional tools for accumulation, but they are not a panacea for all financial situations. As your net worth grows, financial complexity often outpaces the capabilities of an algorithm. We generally recommend consulting a licensed human professional—such as a CPA or a fee-only Certified Financial Planner—once your investable assets surpass $1 million, or if you encounter specific life events. These events include navigating an IPO, managing a small business with complex cash flows, dealing with a divorce, or establishing a special needs trust. In these scenarios, the tax implications of a wrong move can cost tens of thousands of dollars."}}]}9:["slug","best-robo-advisors-2026","d"]

A quality robo-advisor will construct portfolios with a weighted average expense ratio between 0.05% and 0.15%.

In a high-interest environment like 2026, holding 6% to 10% of your portfolio in a low-interest cash sweep can cost you significantly more in lost opportunity than a transparent 0.25% management fee.

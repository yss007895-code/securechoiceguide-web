The primary vector for attack is no longer just targeted phishing, but 'Evil Twin' attacks and packet sniffing on unsecured public networks. In airports, hotels, and cafes, threat actors can easily spin up rogue access points that mimic legitimate Wi-Fi networks.

When accessing banking portals abroad, ensure you are using a dedicated browser profile free of third-party extensions that could scrape screen data. We strictly advise against SMS-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), as SIM swapping attacks are prevalent in many tourist hubs. Instead, utilize hardware security keys like YubiKeys or offline authenticator apps (e.g., Aegis or Raivo) that do not rely on cellular signals."}}]}9:["slug","best-vpn-for-travel-2026","d"]

Free VPNs often monetize by selling user data, injecting ads, or employing weak encryption standards.

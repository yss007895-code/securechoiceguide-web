That is rarely the default behavior. Without a dedicated kill switch, your device is programmed to immediately seek the next available connection to keep you online. This means the millisecond your encrypted tunnel drops—whether due to a server timeout or a Wi-Fi signal fluctuation—your traffic reverts to your standard ISP connection."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about system-level vs. application-level kill switches?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not all kill switches operate the same way. The most robust version is the System-Level Kill Switch (often called a 'Hard' kill switch). This acts like a firewall rule: if the VPN application isn't running or the tunnel collapses, it blocks all network traffic entering or leaving the device. Nothing gets through until the encrypted tunnel is re-established. This is the gold standard for security."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about the mobile dilemma: android and ios limitations?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Desktop operating systems give VPN developers deep access to network drivers, but mobile OS environments are more restrictive. On iOS, true kill switches are notoriously difficult to implement because Apple restricts how apps can control the system's network stack. Many 'kill switches' on iPhones are actually just auto-reconnect scripts that might leak data for a few seconds."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about how to test your kill switch (don't trust, verify)?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You shouldn't take a software company's word for it. Testing your kill switch is straightforward. First, connect to your VPN and start a continuous activity, like streaming a 4K video or running a legal torrent download. While it's running, force-close the VPN application through your Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)—do not use the 'Disconnect' button, as that tells the app to shut down gracefully."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about why 'auto-connect' is not a kill switch?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A common misconception is that 'Auto-Connect' serves the same purpose.
